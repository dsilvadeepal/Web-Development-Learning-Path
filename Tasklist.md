<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
<ul>
<li>have git commits every week, most of the days of the week</li>
<li>try to get in one of <a class="mention" href="https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/tropicalchancer">@tropicalchancer</a>'s cohorts - be active once you're in</li>
<li>code in your own editor, if you don't know where to start start with Brackets</li>
<li>try to pick at least one language besides JavaScript, and solve some of the algorithmic challenges with that language (Good choices: Java, Python, Golang, Rust)</li>
</ul>
<h4>For each item you should:</h4>
<ul>
<li>take notes, on a blog, in markdown, wherever, somewhere - not about what you read, or about what the instructor said - about what you learned</li>
<li>build something - even if it's just a 20 line function that computes something you find interesting</li>
<li>code in your own editor - if you don't know which to pick, start with Brackets</li>
<li>if you build something, document it and test it as appropriate</li>
<li>do the exercises, build the projects - fully, not some scaled down halfassery</li>
</ul>
<h4>For four (or more) projects of your choosing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seek 1-3 other developers to collaborate on the project</li>
<li>Coordinate with the team to complete the project</li>
<li>Build the project out to a full production quality application</li>
<li>Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigorously test the final product.</li>
<li>Resolve any legitimate issues found</li>
</ul>
<h4>Once per month - do two or more of the following:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what you learned that month</li>
<li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo">this video</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo">this video</a>&nbsp;- on interviewing</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html">this</a>&nbsp;- on crafting a resume</li>
<li>Do one lesson from <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345">CUST104: Business Communications</a></li>
<li>Live stream what you're working on for an hour. Or, lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.</li>
<li>Catch up on industry reading on sites like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>, <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles">A List Apart</a>, <a href="http://uxmyths.com/">UX Myths</a>, <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>If you need a breather from an item, do one of these, then get back to it</h4>
<ul>
<li>complete a project from FCC that isn't included in this list</li>
<li>pick a pet web development project you can code in a week and complete it</li>
<li>write a guide for the FCC wiki or create a video tutorial and post it to YouTube</li>
<li>redo any of the algorithmic type projects you've already completed from the list, in a language other than JavaScript</li>
<li>pick an open source project from <a href="https://www.codetriage.com/">Code Triage</a>&nbsp;and contribute to fixing an open issue</li>
<li>visit the FCC forum and pick a couple of the toughest questions, that people are having trouble getting help with, and help them</li>
<li>code a flash cards application, for jotting quick notes you can use to quiz yourself later</li>
</ul>
